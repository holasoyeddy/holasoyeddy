My name is **Eddy Rubio** and I am your host. I am a software engineer based out of Mexico City. I love technology, martial arts and building useful stuff. 

I am a humble brazilian jiu-jitsu white belt.

The main purpose of this blog is to document any thoughts I may have or things I have learned throughout my tenure as a software developer in the form of blog posts, tutorials, guides or any other format that may be useful. 

I do this in an attempt to archive this knowledge for future references and also to help out any software engineers that may find my posts insightful.
